How to Use the System
The dashboard serves as the main navigation interface, allowing users to access various functionalities. Opening dashboard.html provides access to the equipment and infrastructure booking sections.

To request sports equipment, users can visit request-equipment.html, where they can select the required equipment, specify the quantity, and set the duration of usage. Once submitted, the request is sent to the admin panel for approval.

For booking sports facilities, users should navigate to infrastructurebp.html, select the desired facility, choose a date and time slot, and submit the request. The admin panel will process the request, and users can track its status.

Administrators can manage equipment requests through admin-request.html and infrastructure bookings via admin-infrastructurebp.html. The admin panel provides the functionality to approve or reject requests, ensuring smooth management of sports resources.




Implemented Features
The system allows users to book sports equipment with real-time tracking. Infrastructure reservations for courts and other sports facilities are available with time slot management. An admin panel is integrated to review and manage all requests. Users can track the status of their requests. LocalStorage is used for seamless data handling within the browser.




Known Issues
Since LocalStorage is used instead of a database, data is not persistent and is lost when the browser is reset. Users must manually refresh the page to see status updates as real-time updates are not implemented. There are no restrictions on multiple bookings, which means users can submit unlimited requests without limitation.
